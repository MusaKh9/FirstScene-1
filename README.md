# FirstScene

## Overview

**FirstScene** is an introductory project designed for 3D Graphics Programming students to start working with indoor scenery. It provides a foundational setup for exploring 3D rendering concepts.

## Scene Description

- The scene includes:
  - A **camera model**: Provided for visualization purposes but **must be removed in final scenes**.
  - A **GLUT teapot**: A placeholder object that can be replaced with a proper 3D model in future iterations.

**Note**: The scene is implemented using the **fixed pipeline** and contains **deprecated code**.

## Usage

1. Use this scene to practice setting up and rendering indoor environments.
2. Familiarize yourself with the provided models and experiment with lighting, textures, and other scene enhancements.
3. **Replace the camera model** and **substitute the GLUT teapot** with your own 3D models as you progress.
4. Convert the scene to the **programmable pipeline** and eliminate all **deprecated code**.

Happy Coding!
